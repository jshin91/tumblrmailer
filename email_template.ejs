  <p>
    How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been almost <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
    since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Grace Hopper Academy and enjoying my time.

    I've been blogging about my experiences at Grace Hopper on my blog. 
    Check out my new posts here and stay tuned for updates: 
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].href %> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
